# Blackjack

A version of the traditional blackjack card game. This was an early programming assignment for CIT591 at UPenn.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software to run this code:

```
Eclipse (or other Java IDE)
```
```
JDK
```
```
JUnit
```

### Installing

In order to use Java, you need to first install the Java Development Kit (JDK).

Youâ€™ll also need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which includes the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

You can download and install the JDK, which includes the JRE (and JVM) [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

Eclipse is one of two main IDEs for Java development.

You can download and install Eclipse [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

Once Java and Eclipse are installed, download the src/slidePuzzle folder.

Create a new Java project in Eclipse:
```
File > New > Java Project
```

And name this project slidePuzzle. Within this project, create a new package:

```
File > New > Package
```

And name this package slidePuzzle. Within this package, create the 9 classes listed in the src folder and import the code.

## Playing the game

The ```main``` method is contained within Blackjack.java.
